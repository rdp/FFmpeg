TODO:
  use "real" frames, maybe...make it adjust them up...
    parameter: number of frames
  cleanup
   drain...
  rename again
  it should *work*
    it should work with a file played against itself..should be perfect...
  allow terminate with fewer...

maybe:
better pin names
fix name with amerge

I think they can use af_astreamsync to add in their own arbitrary "this one before that one" and it will work including splitting things...

with stereo inputs -> segfault
  amerge seems to seg fault on error, too

fix "astreamsync -filter_complex "astreamsync""

the docu should exist and warn that you prolly want astreamsync ...

does astreamsync want/already have "init pos" ?

have my own buffer...maybe move it inline? If I did then...I could...propagate it locally and accept
arbitrary sized chunks, and in different orders...actually just fixing astreamsync for now might be enough...
